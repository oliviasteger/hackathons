## Inspiration
Our team was inspired to build this site after the recent election. We decided that it was important to support organizations that helped causes we believe in.
## What it does
Our project allows organizations to add information about themselves to a database, and users can view this information, and narrow it down by choosing categories they are most interested in. Users can also add protests to the database, and add information about those. Users can also search The Guardian through our website for more information regarding these categories.
## How we built it
We built our website with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We used Object Oriented Programming to organize our code.
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge that came up was our database. It was not always reliable, and we had to change our input forms to make it fully work.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we've made a project that can help people, and can be used after this hackathon.
## What we learned
We learned that teamwork and communication are key when multiple people are working on the same documents.
## What's next for My Action
Next, we plan to utilize the New York Times API, along with other respected newspapers, to add to our search function.
